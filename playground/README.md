# FPO + MuJoCo Playground

This directory contains implementations of FPO and PPO in MuJoCo Playground.
It's adapted from and inherits implementation details from
[Brax](https://github.com/google/brax)'s PPO implementation.

The directory is structured as follows:

```
.
├── train_fpo.ipynb          - Interactive notebook for FPO training.
├── train_ppo.ipynb          - Interactive notebook for PPO training.
│
├── src/flow_policy/
│   ├── fpo.py               - FPO algorithm implementation.
│   ├── ppo.py               - PPO algorithm implementation.

```

## Setup

This package has been tested in Python 3.12 on an RTX 4090. We generally use `conda` for environment management.

1. Install JAX into your environment with CUDA support:

   ```bash
   pip install "jax[cuda12]==0.7.0"
   ```

2. Install the package:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .  # From the `fpo/playground` directory.
   ```

3. Start with the notebooks for interactive training:

   - `train_fpo.ipynb` - Flow Policy Optimization
   - `train_ppo.ipynb` - Proximal Policy Optimization

4. For training with wandb logging, run the scripts with `--help` to see available options:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_fpo.py --help
   python scripts/train_ppo.py --help
   ```

## Results

The final cell of each training notebook renders a result from a trained policy.
